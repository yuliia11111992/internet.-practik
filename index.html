            or next day</h2>
        <p>Our coverage area is much smaller than that of large providers. This allows us to work quickly: 64% of subscribers receive Internet and TV immediately on the day of application. Even if you need to connect a private house, not an apartment.</p>

    <img src="./images/dialog.jpg" alt="dialog" width="40" height="40"/>
    <h2>«We have been using World.net for seven years»</h2>
    <p>«We connected it for a rented apartment, and now we use it in ours. For 7 years, only one call was made to support - to change the installation address. It can be called the quality standard for modern Internet providers. The level of service is excellent. No connection breaks, no modem connection, the Internet, in fact, over a dedicated line. Bonus program for regular subscribers up to 20% discount on the tariff plan»</p>
